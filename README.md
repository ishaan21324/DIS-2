This website was made with simplicity in mind for the end user. Information is communicated clearly and only a basic description of each project is given.
Javascript was used to create interactive behaviours such as the rotating tank which follows the mouse and the eyes of the snake which point toward the cursor.

The tank uses a sprite that was downloaded and the snake head has been developed from scratch.
